## Example Spring REST End-Point with a DEB Package

**Prerequisites:**  
STS - https://spring.io/tools/sts/all  
Apache Maven - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi  
jdeb - https://github.com/tcurdt/jdeb   

This was just a exercise for creating a DEB package for Ubuntu. Since this is a spring project, I used the STS for my IDE with Apache Maven as my package manager. The DEB was built using jdeb.
